## Introduction

Breadit is a is a Reddit-style social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Because we all need another one of those, right?

Thankfully, this one is a little different. Think Reddit, but with numerous bread-related images and puns.

## Background

It was created as a back-end project while studying at [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com), to provide a back-end server to my [front-end project](https://github.com/PaulBondUK/breadit-news-frontend).

## Technologies

Breadit was created using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Knex, with full TDD (Chai + Supertest).
